## Modules

Backbone.php modules are classes or a collection of related classes. A module is referenced by its classname with a filename formatted as ClassName.class.php. Modules are loaded using the `Backbone::uses()` method. To load a Backbone.php module, just pass in the module name. To load a module within your web root directory, pass in the relative path beginning with a forward slash '/'. If the name does not begin with a forward slash, then Backbone.php will assume that the path is relative to the framework's directory.

	// load a backbone module
	Backbone::uses("Model");
	
	// load multiple backbone modules
	Backbone::uses(array("Model", "View", "Collection"));
	
	// load a backbone extension
	Backbone::uses("/extensions/ExtensionModule");
	
	// load an application specific model located at ./models/Person.class.php
	Backbone::uses("/models/Person");

Modules are only loaded once and subsequent calls to `Backbone::uses()` will be ignored if the module was previously loaded.
