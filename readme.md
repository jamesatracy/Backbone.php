Backbone.php
============

Backbone.php, much like its javascript namesake, is a small collection of scripts that provide structure or scaffolding for a php application or php powered website. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) convention and includes classes for handling routes, database backed models, and HTML views. Applications or websites built using Backbone.php can be up and running very quickly because it removes the necessity of writing much of the boilerplate code.

The framework is built with the following goals in mind:

* Lightweight: The core of Backbone.php provides just the right amount of structure and flexibility without being overly complicated.

* Modular: Backbone.php is highly modular and provides a simple mechanism for including other framework and application specific modules.

* Best Practices: Backbone.php is designed with software engineering best practices in mind, including MVC and Object-Oriented programming.

At its most simplest form, a Backbone.php application is nothing more than a series of url routes (such as "/about/") that are mapped to either views ("views/about-page.php") or callback methods ("public function about($args)") or both. That is essentially all that you need to get a Backbone.php application up and running. However, the framework also provides a number of classes for working specifically with data backed by a MySQL database in the form of Models and Collections.

File Structure
--------------

Backbone.php consists of the core framework code in a /backbone/ directory and five files that must be placed in your application's web root: 'htacces', 'backbone.php', 'config.php', 'boot.php', and 'index.php'

* htaccess Uses Apache's mod_rewrite module to funnel all page requests to the index.php script, which allows for url fragments to be routed to mapped view code.

* backbone.php Initializes the Backbone.php framework and sets up the request object. This file should not be modified.

* config.php Sets up several directory constants required by Backbone.php to find the core framework, application, and view directories. By modifiying the FRAMEWORK constant you can place the core /backbone/ directory elsewhere than your web root.

* boot.php Sets the web root relative path, loads routers, and performs other application specific bootstraping.

* index.php Dispatches requests through routers registered by the application. Should not be modified.
