Backbone.php, much like its javascript namesake, is a small collection of PHP classes that provide structure or scaffolding for a PHP application or PHP powered website. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) convention and includes classes for handling routes, database backed models, and HTML views. Applications or websites built using Backbone.php can be up and running very quickly because it removes the necessity of writing much boilerplate code.

**NOTE: This project is pre-1.0 and the code may change in significant and backward incompatible ways between releases.**

The framework is built with the following goals in mind:

* *Lightweight*: The core of Backbone.php provides just the right amount of structure and flexibility without being overly complicated.

* *Modular*: Backbone.php is highly modular and provides a simple mechanism for including other framework and application specific modules.

* *Best Practices*: Backbone.php is designed with software engineering best practices in mind, including MVC, Object-Oriented programming, and unit testing.

At its most simplest form, a Backbone.php application is nothing more than a series of url routes (such as "/about/") that are mapped to either views ("views/about-page.php") or callback methods ("public function about($request)") or combinations of both. 

You can define routes for any HTTP method:

	// index is a global function
	Router::get("/", "index");
	Router::post("/", "index");
	Router::put("/", "index");
	Router::delete("/", "index");
	Router::method("CUSTOM", "/", "index");
	
You can route requests directly to view files:

	// routes to view file located at /views/about.php
	Router::get("/about", "View@about");
	// routes to view file located at /views/about/jobs.php
	Router::get("/about/jobs/", "View@about/jobs");
	
You can route requests to controller methods:

	// routes to AppController->index() located at /controllers/AppController.class.php
	Router::get("/", "/controllers/AppController@index");
	
	public function index($request)
	{
		...
	}
	
You can create routes with url arguments:

	Router::get("/path/:name/:id/", "/controllers/AppController@doSomething");
	
	public function doSomething($request, $name, $id)
	{
		...
	}

You can also define route aliases so that you can generate links with correct paths:

	Router::get("/", "/controllers/MyController@index")->alias("home");
	Router::getRouteFromAlias("home");
	// returns "/"
	
You can even use `getRouteFromAlias` to generate paths with url arguments filled in:
	
	Router::get("/jobs/:department/:id/", "/controllers/MyController@jobDesc")->alias("job-description");
	Router::getRouteFromAlias("job-description", array("engineering", 24));
	// returns "/jobs/engineering/24/"

That is essentially all that you need to get a Backbone.php application up and running. However, the framework also provides a number of classes for working specifically with data backed by a SQL database in the form of Models and Collections.

	$dog = Dog::create({
		"name" => "Spot",
		"breed" => "Collie"
	});
	$id = $dog->id;
	
	$dog = Dog::fetch(1); // with id = 1
	$dog->name = "Spot";
	$dog->save();
	
	$dogs = Dog::fetch()->where("breed", "Collie")->limit(10)->exec();
	while($dog->valid()) {
		$dog = $dog->next();
		...
	}
